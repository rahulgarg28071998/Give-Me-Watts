An intelligent solution for  Electrical car support system which includes

# Inspiration
A complete ecosystem for Electric Vehicle Management for a country in which EV is not much popular. The flow of the app:- a user with an EV enters an electric station, The RFID tag on the car detects the user, and a notification comes up on its mobile and also on the car's panel with voice. The notification then redirects the user to a website which is affiliated with the local shops all around the user. So that before the car charges up, the user can do something to pass time.

# What it does
We had developed an AR app which augments the whole EV on your ground plane. We even have features like Explode the car, so that we can view the interiors of the car as well. 
1.To manage and connect all players to one platform. 
2.Managing charging Stations. 
3.What about the person, running out of charge and need emergency charge. 
4.ML model for predictions of cars sales.

# How I built it
Using voiceflow , we integrated hardware to voiceflow using rfid tagging and create the assistant for user interaction of charging station. the system has full automation , for routing to nearest , fastest and approachable charging sation with some priority based ,urgerncy based system. https://creator.voiceflow.com/demo/3237451435481279
